# Alzheimers_Detection


This project aims to detect Alzheimer's disease using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data and LightGBM for clinical data. The final predictions are combined using a logistic regression model to produce the final output.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- LightGBM
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
